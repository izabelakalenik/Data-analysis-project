Final project for System Analysis and Decision Support Methods course - 4th semester.

The project involves analyzing a publicly available dataset - Music and Mental Health Analysis - downloaded from kaggle.com. 
The data pertains to the listening habits of various music genres and their impact on specific mental disorders. 
It includes information such as the number of hours of music listened to per day, the intensity of listening to individual genres, 
and the level of mental disorders on a scale from 1 to 10. The data were collected from individuals of different ages who filled out a Google online form based on their preferences. 
The data collection period ranged from August 27, 2022, to November 9, 2022.

For my research, I needed information about the favorite music genre of the participants 
(I selected 4 genres: classical music, electronic music - EDM, pop music, metal music), 
the number of hours of music listened to per day, and the level of intensity of anxiety, depression, and insomnia.

I conducted the following experiments for the data:
* Linear regression,
* Linear model, GLM, SVM,
* Normal distribution

**Technologies used:**
* Pandas: A versatile data manipulation library that facilitated seamless handling and exploration of my dataset.
* IPython: Leveraging functionalities from IPython enhanced the presentation of my results and streamlined the development process.
* Matplotlib and Seaborn: These visualization libraries empowered me to create visually appealing and informative plots, bringing my data to life.
* Scipy: The scientific computing library played a crucial role in conducting statistical analyses, providing valuable insights into the underlying patterns.
* Scikit-learn: This machine learning library was instrumental in implementing and evaluating various models, contributing to the predictive aspects of my project.
* NumPy: As a fundamental numerical computing library, NumPy facilitated efficient numerical operations and array manipulations.
